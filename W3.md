1. _How are private and public visibility modifiers handled when fields/methods with these different visibilities are inherited from a parent class?
From a grandparent class?
How do classes outside the class inheritance hierarchy see (or not see) fields/methods with these different modifiers?_
  - Private fields are kept in memory from a parent class but cannot be accessed, Public fields are kept in memory AND can be accessed from memory
2. The answer is option 4 because it declares local fields x and y and initializes them to the **public** getter methods for x and y. It then calls the **public** setter method to correctly update the x and y
    values
3. The code would crash because the super method would need to be called before the setXY method.
4. If we switched lines 1 and 2 then the code would compile and super would initialize the x and y fields and setXY would update their values.
5. Options 1 and 2 would work because we call the reflect method and call super.sum_x_y() on the parent class (option 2 implements slightly differently but still gets the same result).
6. The point of the protected modifier is to allow an intermediate visibility between public and private-meaning inherited classes can access parent fields/methods but other programs cannot.
7. public class FormulaOne extends Racecar{
    private String make;
    public FormulaOne(int n, Driver d, String m){
      super(n, d);
      make = m;
    }
    public String toString(){
      return super.toString() + " " + make;
    }

8. The code works for both mark A and mark B because add sponser is defined in racecar and formula 1 inherits it.

10. A public static field comes in handy when you want a field that doesn't need to be changed, be accessed by everyone, and belong to the class itself.
